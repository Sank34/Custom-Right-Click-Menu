# How to use it?
## To use the context-menu and customise it, you have to modify the options. The code comes with some examples you can use:
```html
    <a href="#" onclick="redirect('https://scienceturtles.com')">
                <img src="https://scienceturtles.com/assests/img/pfp.png" class="img" /> ScienceTurtles <img src="assets/img/arrowcircleright2.svg" alt="arrow" id="arrow">
    </a> 
    <!-- It uses anchor tags(<a>) in order to make it easier to work. 
        - The anchor tag contains: - href rule, you can use it for redirects
                                   - onclick: here you can make a function in cmenu.min.js and execute it by putting it on the onclick rule!
                                   - the img tags: first one is the img that it's displayed in the left, the second one is the img tag containing the svg for the redirect option
     -->
```
